# Mac OS
# Faiz Imam — Engineering Portfolio

> _“And say: My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”_ — **Qur’an 20:114**

A Mac-OS–inspired interactive portfolio built with React.  
Designed to showcase **clean frontend work**, **solid backend understanding**, and a mindset rooted in **discipline, consistency, and trust in Allah**.

This project is not about trends.  
It’s about fundamentals, clarity, and building things that work.

- Writing clean, readable code  
- Building responsive, usable interfaces

- Improving daily — without shortcuts  

I believe effort is my responsibility, and results are by the will of **Allah**.
